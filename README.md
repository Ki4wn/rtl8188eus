# Realtek RTL8188EUS v5.3.9

## Driver support for rtl8188eu, rtl8188eus and rtl8188etv chipsets.
## Linux & Android 8 is supported and alongside various boards/architectures.

# This driver supports:
* Android 8 (checking Android 9 soon)
* MESH mode operation
* Monitor mode

# TODO
* Add more VHT capabilities (HT Greenfield will be added)
* Add frame injection (packet injection)
* Enable TX queue in monitor mode
* Add old/new kernel support (up to kernel v5.0"
* Add DKMS support
* Add the 8812/8814 & 8821 HAL (and make them all supported in 1 module)
* Move the 8192EU HAL onto this base (not sure of this one yet)

++++ lots to walkthrough over here still


We'll check the posiblities to move our rtl8812au driver onto this base.
This looks like a clean, better Realtek base! More information coming.
